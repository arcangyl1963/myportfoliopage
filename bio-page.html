            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="biopage">I’m James Harris and I am a web developer in Atlanta, GA.</p>
            <p class="biopage">I have approximately 20 years of experience in the Information Technology field with software companies
                and publishing companies for magazines and newspapers.</p>
            <p class="biopage">I was originally a graphic designer for a small newspaper in North Alabama while finishing up some
                post-graduate studies in Graphic Design from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, AL. I was
                recruited by an employee of a software developer in Philadelphia, PA whom I had met while they were
                installing a digital asset management system for advertising materials at the small newspaper in
                Huntsville. I moved to Philadelphia and started what would be a long career in the IT industry.</p>
            <p class="biopage">I moved to Atlanta, GA in 2002 after the events of 9/11 had a drastic effect on sales at the software
                company in Philadelphia. They no longer needed two integration teams for the products I supported and
                installed at locations around the U.S. One of the customers I had installed a system for, trained their
                employees, and supported was Creative Loafing Newspapers based in Atlanta, GA. They heard that I had
                been laid off by the software developer, reached out to me via a contact at the software company, and
                later offered me a position in their IT Department. After holding several positions in the department, I
                eventually took on the role of the IT Department manager.</p>
            <p class="biopage">Four years ago, after the company had been sold and had changed owners a few times, the original owner
                reacquired the company in April 2017. In our first discussion in several years since he had lost the
                company in Chapter 13 to capital investors, he told me he didn’t really need an IT person but instead
                needed a web developer. He was asking me to transition into that role on the assumption that anyone in
                IT knew how to build websites. That was far from the truth. I knew very little other than how to support
                the infrastructures required for websites – servers, operating systems, and network technologies such as
                DNS, SSL, SSH, etc. Another new journey began becoming a mostly self-taught web developer. That is the
                title I was given at least, but I was more of a web content manager.</p>
            <p class="biopage">Then came 2020. Everyone’s work changed. We all became a mostly remote work force after everything
                shutdown in March of that year. That included Creative Loafing’s work force. All of the Creative Loafing
                staff was officially laid off that March. We became contract employees working one to two weeks a month
                to publish a monthly print edition. Others, including myself, were able to work about 15 hours a week in
                between.</p>
            <p class="biopage">In 2021, it was time for one final journey. I decided to return to school and study to become an actual
                web developer. I had a decent base knowledge of the skills needed for the task, but I needed to learn
                the additional skill set that the position of web developer required. That is when I decided to apply
                for the Full Stack Flex bootcamp at Georgia Tech. A friend had taken the course last year and suggested
                it might be something I would be interested in given my background and career interests.</p>
            <p class="biopage">That’s where I am today. Learning the ins and outs of web development, honing existing knowledge of HTML
                and CSS, and learning new languages like JavaScript and Python. This bio section will evolve to more of
                a showcase and marketing tool as the course progresses by adding more specific details regarding these
                newly learned skills and the projects completed from the course.</p>
